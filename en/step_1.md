## What you will need

### Hardware

As well as a Raspberry Pi with an SD card and the usual peripherals, you'll also need:

|1x Solderless breadboard | Male-to-female jumper leads | Female-to-female jumper leads | Male-to-male jumper leads |
|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
| ![breadboard](images/breadboard.png) | ![m to f jumper leads](images/jumper-male-to-female.png) | ![f to f jumper leads](images/jumper-female-to-female.png) | ![m to m jumper leads](images/jumper-male-to-male.png) |

| 1x Tactile button | 3x LEDs | Ultrasonic distance sensor| Passive infrared motion sensor |
|:--------:|:-------:|:--------:|:--------:|
