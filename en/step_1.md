## What you will do

In this resource you will learn how to use the GPIO pins on your Raspberry Pi to interface with electronic components, such as LEDs and PIRs.

## What you will learn

By working through this resource, you will learn how to use Python and GPIO Zero to control:

- [LEDs and buttons](physical-computing-with-python/worksheet.md)
- [an active buzzer](physical-computing-with-python/buzzer.md)  
- [traffic lights](physical-computing-with-python/trafficlights.md)  
- [a light-dependent resistor](physical-computing-with-python/ldr.md)  
- [a PIR motion sensor](physical-computing-with-python/pir.md)  
- [an ultrasonic distance sensor](physical-computing-with-python/distance.md)
- [analogue inputs](physical-computing-with-python/analogue.md)
